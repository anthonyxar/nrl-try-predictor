"""
NRL Prediction Model - powered by historical data (2020-2026).

V1: Position base rates, player career try factor, team attack/defence, flat home advantage.
V2: Recency-weighted form (last-5 vs last-10 blending), edge vulnerability,
    venue-specific home advantage, weather/ground conditions.
V3: All V2 factors plus:
    - Margin-of-victory weighted form (big wins count more than scrappy wins)
    - Rest days / short turnaround penalty (5-day turnarounds penalised)
    - Bye-week boost (teams coming off a bye are fresher)
    - Season progression weighting (early-season results discounted)
    - Opponent-quality adjusted try rates (tries vs strong defences worth more)
    - Try minute distribution (first-half vs second-half scorer profiles)
    - Interchange timing (bench minutes based on actual interchange data)
    - Probability calibration from historical prediction accuracy
